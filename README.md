- Real-time visibility into vehicle or package location
- Inefficient delivery routes ‚Üí increased fuel costs
- Poor customer experience ‚Üí customers don‚Äôt know when a package will arrive
- Lack of transparency for dispatchers ‚Üí can‚Äôt track delays or driver behavior
- Manual paperwork ‚Üí invoices, delivery confirmations etc.
- No centralized dashboard ‚Üí data scattered across spreadsheets, WhatsApp groups, phone calls

| Dispatcher/Admin

- Assign drivers & routes
- See all vehicle positions
- Know if delivery is delayed/on-time
- Generate reports / invoices

| Driver

- See route
- Report package status (picked up, delivered)
- Update location

| Customer

- Live package tracking
- Expected arrival time
- Proof of delivery
- Invoice

üöÄ Features That Solve Real Problems
üîÅ Core Logic
Feature Why It‚Äôs Valuable
Live vehicle location updates (every 5s) Dispatcher knows which driver is where, can optimize routes
Route assignment UI (drag/drop) Dispatcher can easily assign deliveries
Delivery status updates (e.g. picked up, in transit, delivered) Helps customer and dispatcher know delivery progress
Customer-facing tracking page Improves customer trust and experience
PDF invoice generation after delivery Automates admin work
Background job processing (BullMQ) Reliable and async updates (e.g. scheduled notifications)
Authentication system (JWT + refresh) Secure access control
Driver mobile web app (lite version) Low-cost way to update delivery status
Offline Mode (optional later) For rural areas, queue location updates when back online

üí° Bonus / Advanced Features
Feature Reason to Add It
Driver behavior metrics (e.g. avg speed, idle time) Fleet optimization
ETA prediction using traffic API Better customer experience
Notifications (email/SMS on delivery status) Improves engagement
Multi-tenant system (for SaaS use) Sell to multiple logistics companies
Admin analytics dashboard Business reporting (on-time %, fuel savings, etc)
Role-based access control (RBAC) Enterprise-ready

üß± MVP Definition
To make this GitHub project realistic and valuable to recruiters/companies, the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) should include:

Area MVP Scope
Backend API Auth (JWT), vehicles, drivers, routes, deliveries, real-time location updates via Redis pub/sub
Frontend Dispatcher dashboard + live map, basic UI for assigning routes
Realtime Vehicle location updates on map every 5s
Customer UI Tracking page with map + delivery status
PDF / Jobs Background job for invoice generation & email (BullMQ)

üß∞ Technology Justification
Tech Why Use It
Go or Node.js High performance for real-time & REST APIs
PostgreSQL Advanced queries, spatial extensions (PostGIS) possible
Redis (Pub/Sub) Fast location updates without polling
Redis (BullMQ) Robust background job queue
React + Mapbox Smooth interactive maps
JWT + Refresh Tokens Secure session handling
PDFKit / Puppeteer Generate invoices from HTML templates
