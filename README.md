Example: First-Mile Delivery Business
Business Type: A logistics company that specializes in picking up goods from manufacturers and bringing them to distribution hubs or warehouses.

Scenario:
A company called "FreshFarm Logistics" works with farms and food producers to collect fresh produce daily and deliver it to central distribution centers where it will be sorted and sent to supermarkets.

First-mile here means: From the origin of goods (farms, factories, suppliers) → to the first logistics hub or warehouse.

Roles & Definitions

1. Customer
   Definition:
   In first-mile delivery, the “customer” is typically a business (e.g., a farm, manufacturer, supplier, or exporter) who needs their products transported to a distribution point.

Roles & Responsibilities:

Places pickup orders: Tells the logistics company what goods, how much, and where they need to be picked up.
Prepares goods: Packages and labels items for pickup (often following the logistics company’s standards).
Coordinates schedules: Ensures goods are ready when the driver arrives.
Pays for the service: Based on distance, weight, or service agreement.

Example in our case: FreshFarm's customer is Green Valley Farm, which calls in to arrange pickup of 2 tons of apples for delivery to a city warehouse.

2. Driver
   Definition:
   The driver (sometimes called a courier in smaller deliveries) is the person physically transporting goods from the pickup location to the first distribution hub.

Roles & Responsibilities:

Receives job details from the dispatcher (pickup location, delivery point, schedule, special handling notes).
Picks up goods at the customer’s location.
Verifies the goods match the manifest (right quantity, right items, in good condition).
Secures the load in the vehicle.
Delivers goods to the designated first hub/warehouse.
Updates delivery status in the system or app.

Example in our case: John, a FreshFarm driver, picks up the apples at Green Valley Farm at 6 AM, confirms the count, and drives them to the FreshFarm city warehouse by 9 AM.

3. Dispatcher
   Definition:
   The dispatcher is the coordinator who manages delivery assignments between customers and drivers, making sure pickups and drop-offs happen efficiently.

Roles & Responsibilities:

Assigns jobs to drivers based on route, availability, and load capacity.
Tracks vehicles in real time to ensure on-time pickups and deliveries.
Communicates updates between customers and drivers (delays, route changes, etc.).
Optimizes routes to save time and costs.
Handles issues: Breakdowns, traffic, last-minute customer requests.

Example in our case: Emma, a FreshFarm dispatcher, sees that Green Valley Farm’s pickup is near two other suppliers. She assigns all three pickups to John in one route and updates his app with the order.

Workflow Example
Customer (Green Valley Farm) schedules pickup in FreshFarm’s app.
Dispatcher (Emma) receives the request, groups it with nearby pickups, and assigns it to a driver.
Driver (John) gets the job in his app, picks up the apples, confirms the load, and drives to the warehouse.
Delivery status is updated in the system, and the customer gets notified of successful delivery.
